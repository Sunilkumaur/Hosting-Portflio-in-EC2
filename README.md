# Hosting-Portflio-in-EC2
We created the EC2 instance and made it as a Web Server to hosting my Portfolio in house

Description:
We successfully hosted a portfolio static website in the EC2 instance with basic setting allowing to accessing it from anywhere from the internet. Below are the screenshot of the webserver hosted instance and other supporting screenshots.

Details:
Screenshot 1 is the AWS console view of the running webserver instance with Public IPv4 (3.109.155.18) allowing all the inbound traffic through HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).  
Screenshot 2 is the SSH root user login of the myPortfolio instance which was installed with httpd and made it as the webserver ready to hosting. The source code is captured from the actual portfolio in the internet (sunilkumaur.github.io).
Screenshot 3 is the live webserver running in the internet which was accessible to the internet user.
